TrueType and PostScript Autohinting
-----------------------------------

Michal Nowakowski in Poland and Alexej Kryukov of Moscow State
University have taken over TrueType and PostScript autohinting and are
doing a far better job than I could have.

Blocks of real type
-------------------

[Ben Weiner](http://readingtype.org.uk/) from Reading provided the
banner image of blocks of real type. The type face is Imprint, created
by Monotype (UK).

SourceForge
-----------

I owe David Turner (and everyone else) of
[FreeType](http://freetype.sf.net/) a debt for providing an API which
allows me to debug truetype instructions. Also he came up with the name
"websharpstudios".

Inspiration
-----------

websharpstudios was inspired by AltSys's
[Fontographer](http://www.macromedia.com/software/fontographer/) now
rescued from MacroMedia by FontLab. Godfrey DiGiorgi encouraged me to
buy my first copy of Fontographer in the mid-80s.

My father inspired a general interest in typography (though he is
interested in renaissance printing techniques rather than computers).

And finally I owe thanks to Linda Dozier, David Cole and everyone at
NaviSoft which company has given me the free time to write this program.
